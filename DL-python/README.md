Deep Learning on Agave
======================

These are the materials that were presented on November 4th, 2019 for
the python workshop offered by ASU's Research Computing department.

Some of the sub directories offer links to host the notebooks and
labs, but note that these are not being run on ASU resources.


Run these materials interactively
---------------------------------

To interact with these materials, we recommend using 
the linked colabs in the tutorials when available or
jupyter lab.


Install Conda Env
-----------------

The `keras` and `pytorch` examples each have their own python
environments. Follow the directions within those subdirectories
(see the respective `README.md` files) for installing the environment
with `conda`.
